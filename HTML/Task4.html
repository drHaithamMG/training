        <h2>The Journey to the Lake</h2>
        <p>I still remember going fishing with my grandfather <i>early</i> in the the morning to the lake. He would wake me up before daylight and we would hop into his old ford truck. The morning <i>breeze</i>
        would gently wake me up by the time we arrived at the lake. Once there,he would secure my life-vest and we would jump into this silver boat and head out to his favorite stop. I don't remember the conversations that much,
         but I always enjoyed it just being the two of us and catch the <b>fish</b>.</p>
        <h2>The Cooking</h2>
        <p>No matter what we caught,large or small my grandmother would clean it,season it and habe it fried by lunch time.I wish I had asked her about recipe then,but hindsight is always <strong>20/20</strong>.
        This is why I figured I would merge my new programming skills and create a recipe using <b>HTML</b> list.</p>
